   <li> <h1>What is an API?</h1> 
    <p>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules or protocols that enables software applications to communicate with each other to exchange data, features and functionality.</p>

    <h1>How do APIs work?</h1>
    <p>A simple way to understand how APIs work is to look at a common example—third-party payment processing. When a user purchases a product on an e-commerce site, the site might prompt the user to “Pay with PayPal” or another type of third-party system. This function relies on APIs to make the connection.</p>

    <h1>Types of APIs</h1>
    <p>APIs can be categorized by use case, including data APIs, operating system APIs, remote APIs and web APIs.</p>
<ol><h3>Data (or database) APIs</h3><p>Used to connect applications and database management systems.</p></ol>
<ol><h3>Operating system (local) APIs</h3><p>Used to define how apps use operating system services and resources.</p></ol>
<ol><h3>Remote APIs</h3><p>Used to define how applications on different devices interact.</p></ol>
<ol><h3>Web APIs</h3><p>Used to enable data and functionality transfer over the internet using HTTP protocol.</p></ol>
